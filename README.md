 POLLUTION  REDUCTION  AND EFFICIENT  ENERGY  CONSUMPTION  USING SMART  GRID. 
 
 Our project, at its core, addresses the pressing  issue of in-efficient energy consumption and  wastage and pollution due to carbon emissions in  the field of electricity usage, by utilising the  concept of smart grids through the integration of  advanced machine learning technologies. To  increase the security of smart grids we have  employed the use of Blockchain.
